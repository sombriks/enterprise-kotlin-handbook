# [enterprise-kotlin-handbook][0001]

Some exercises to explore out how modenr, enterprise grade services can be
written in kotlin. It's slightliy opinionated, proceed at your own risk.

## Motivation

Kotlin has a strong case as [java substitute][0002] on Android/mobile scenario
but it's not exclusive to it anymore for a good time now.

This doc go as a gentle approach on how to provision projects using kotlin over
java in enterprise solutions with [spring boot][0003].

The ecosystem around the JVM spans in time over decades and the problems solved
goes beyond thousends of reusable libraries. Get access to shuch richness with
any imaginable stack is a big deal and deserves atention in order to save time,
health and money when starting something new or maintaining battle-tested
solutions out there.

## Before we start

Some people might have a solid background on other stacks.
[Frontend Javascript/Typescript][0004], for example. Whenever handy,
some comparison will be presented.

## How this guide is structure

This is a [monorepo/multiproject][0005], which usually is a bad idea but in this
case we mainly host documentation but offer sample projects to better explore a
subject being presented.

So, main docs resides in [docs](docs) folder, samples in [samples][samples]
folder.
