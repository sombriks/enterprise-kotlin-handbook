## What makes any code _enterprise code_ anyway?

Whenever the piece of code goes fast to production it can be called enterprise.
This is important because it indicates that we're not coding to explore a new
concept or to sample something in a academic paper. We're making money, not art.

To achieve speed, a high degree of code reuse is advised. The [DRY][0050] is
paramount here.

Thanks to [Open Source][0051], mostly in the form of [Apache Foundation][0052],
enterprise java flourished and thrived, making it one of the most prominent
ecosystem able to support this kind of solution.

One would argue that enterprise code is also testable code. Although this is
highly desirable, it's not a rule easily seen out there. In tis guide we'll
cover tests because it builds up our trust in the delivered code.
