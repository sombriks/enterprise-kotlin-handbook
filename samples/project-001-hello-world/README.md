# Hello world

 Classic start for any language.

## Requirements

- java virtual machine 17 or newer properly installed
- kotlin compiler 1.9 or newer available in the command line

## How to compile and run

```bash
kotlinc HelloWorld.kt
kotlin HelloWorldKt
```

## Noteworthy

- Due the java compatibility thing, there always must be a class, so if your
  script only has dangling functions, kotlin compiler creates a class for you.
