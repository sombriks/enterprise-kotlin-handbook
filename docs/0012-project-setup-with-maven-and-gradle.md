# The very foundations of enterprise ~~java~~ kotlin projects

In the [previous charpter][0300] we discussed the language and how it`s  very
dependent on the java/jvm ecosystem.

Now we go through the tools to manage more complex projects which make use of
third party libraries, but first a bit of history.

## The history the way i remember it

work of compile code in the proper way.

## Maven setup

## Gradle setup

## Wrapper scripts

## Popular plugins

## Using java libraries and code from kotlin code
